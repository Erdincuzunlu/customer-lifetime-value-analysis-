Python scripts for Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) calculation and segmentation for retail analytics.
# Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Calculation and Segmentation

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) and performing customer segmentation based on retail transaction data. The provided functions and scripts allow you to analyze customer behavior and segment customers into different groups based on their CLTV.

## Features
- **Data Preparation**: Cleans and prepares retail transaction data.
- **CLTV Calculation**: Computes Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) using transaction data.
- **Segmentation**: Segments customers into different groups based on their CLTV.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name

   Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the required packages using pip:

pip install pandas scikit-learn

Run the Script
Place your retail transaction data in an Excel file and adjust the file path in the script as needed. Then run the Python script to calculate CLTV and perform segmentation:

python your_script_name.py

Usage

The main function create_cltv_c() takes a DataFrame of retail transactions and returns a DataFrame with CLTV calculations and customer segments.

import pandas as pd
from your_script_name import create_cltv_c

# Load your data
df = pd.read_excel('path/to/your/data.xlsx')

# Calculate CLTV and segment customers
clv = create_cltv_c(df)
print(clv.head())
